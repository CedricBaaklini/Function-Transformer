# Function-Transformer
A simple program that will tell you the transformations of your function

## The Main Idea

Every function that you can think of has a transformative form, and it looks something like this:

$$ f'(x) = af(bx - c) + d $$

It doesn't matter the operation, the function will always have **four important terms**. Each term transforms the function in a certain particular way.
